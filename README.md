Event driven simulation for a wireless sensor network.
Developed as an assignment for university course.

Properties:

    - The area is 10km^2
    - The network consists of 1000 motes-sensors - cloud A
    - The motes are uniformly spread
    - One node - Cloud B) - enters the area and croses it at a given speed
    - Once the node enters the area, it starts receiving data from the motes
    - The network reorganizes as the node croses the area
    - Time is measured in seconds
